<br>

![][image-1]

<br>

An iOS 11 graphical user interface element library assembled by [@brentcas][1].

To open the Framer files, you need to have [Framer][2] installed on your macOS device. Download one of Apple’s [iOS UI Design Resources][3] for access to the San Fransisco Pro font. This collection of files is organized into folders like so:

> 01-Style
> - 01-Colors.framer
> - 02-Fonts.framer

> 02-iPhone-8-Elements
> - 01-System.framer
> - 02-Bars.framer
> - 03-Controls.framer
> - 04-Views.framer
> - 05-Keyboards.framer

> 03-iPhone-X-Elements
> - 01-System.framer
> - 02-Bars.framer
> - 03-Controls.framer
> - 04-Views.framer
> - 05-Keyboards.framer

Each Framer file has a collection of designed elements, and contains no prototype code for interactive behavior. These assets are for the purposes of copying and pasting into your own prototypes, or being used as a design reference.

All files have been opened on Framer v112 and may have issues on other versions of Framer.

## Style Guide

### Naming

Each UI layer should be given a code compatible name using camelCase following the Google’s JavaScript [style guide][4].  Names should typically be structured as `element`, `state`, `color`. So, the light version of the status bar with a back button would be `statusBarBackLight`.

Paths, groups, and joins within shapes do not need to be named.

### Positioning Shapes

Shapes should always be within a fixed frame that is responsively positioned. If a shape is part of a group of other layers within a fixed frame, it doesn’t need an additional frame. If a shape is the only layer within a frame, that frame can have the same name as the shape.
