<br>

![][image-1]

<br>

An iOS 11 graphical user interface element library assembled by [@brentcas][1].

To open the Framer files, you need to have [Framer][2] installed on your macOS device. Download one of Apple’s [iOS UI Design Resources][3] for access to the San Fransisco Pro font. This collection of files is organized into folders like so:

> 01-Style
> - 01-Colors.framer
> - 02-Fonts.framer

> 03-iPhone-8-Elements
> - 01-System.framer
> - 02-Bars.framer
> - 03-Controls.framer
> - 04-Views.framer
> - 05-Keyboards.framer

> 04-iPhone-X-Elements
> - 01-System.framer
> - 02-Bars.framer
> - 03-Controls.framer
> - 04-Views.framer
> - 05-Keyboards.framer

Each Framer file has a collection of designed elements, and contains no prototype code. These elements are for the purposes of copying and pasting into your own prototypes, or being used as a design reference.

All files have been opened on Framer v109 and may have issues on other versions of Framer.

## Branches

There are two branches in this repo. For the latest polished version of the design system, use `master`. This branch might not have the latest updates, but it should have consistent organization and be easiest to use. For up to the up to the minute changes, use `beta` which is used to make updates before pushing them to `master`.
